                                Our daughter, Leah was only 45 when she took her own life. She was an accomplished teacher and writer, who left behind a husband and two young daughters. She was living in France when she began thinking and feeling a great pain, but doctors found her to be extraordinarily healthy. She was in crisis when her husband returned with her to the United States, and our home. We made appointments for her with a medical doctor and a psychiatrist. We were told only a doctor could prescribe medicine for her. The doctor’s appointment was for the next week, but the Psychiatrist could not see her for more than a month. She killed herself less than a week after she arrived at our home.

                                As we read the story about Leah in Friday's paper we knew we wanted to help raise money for suicide prevention. The article mentioned that there have been 17 suicides in McLean county so far this year . One of those 17 is our son. I am asking our friends and family to join us Sunday for the walk. Thank you for asking the public to join in.

                                Theresa Ruble, my wife of 34 years, died of mental illness Dec. 25, 2011 (shortly after Leah.)  She had suffered from the disease for years. Ginger, our faithful dog,  was only family member with her when she died. Ginger will join me on the walk. Maybe Ginger's first and last walk as vet found a growth in her stomach last week.
