                                Our daughter, Leah was only 45 when she took her own life. She was an accomplished teacher and writer, who left behind a husband and two young daughters. She was living in France when she began thinking and feeling a great pain, but doctors found her to be extraordinarily healthy. She was in crisis when her husband returned with her to the United States, and our home. We made appointments for her with a medical doctor and a psychiatrist. We were told only a doctor could prescribe medicine for her. The doctor’s appointment was for the next week, but the Psychiatrist could not see her for more than a month. She killed herself less than a week after she arrived at our home.

                            <p>We held our first LeahWalk last year and although we sent announcement postcards to all the helping agencies and professionals, not one responded nor participated.  Our community is in great need for an understanding and acknowledgement of mental illness.</p>
                            <p>We chose the Sunday after Thanksgiving for our WALK because we want to remember with gratitude those lives we’ve lost to mental illness; and because we want to reject the commercialism of Black Friday that intervenes. We will renew and rejoice in Nature instead.</p>
                            <p>Please join us any way you can.</p>
